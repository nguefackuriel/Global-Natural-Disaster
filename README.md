# Global-Natural-Disaster

This work is related to my participation at the UNBDH(United Nations Big Data Hackathon). My team and I worked on 
Using Big Data and Data science to develop ideas and solutions to adress Global Challenges and help achieve Sustainable Development Goals.

We interested ourselves on Global Natural Disaster using data from 1970 to 2021. 

28 Countries were analysed, it was observed that a total of 8 billion people were affected, 
we had 4 billion US dollars of damages and 4 millions people lost their lives.

We first made some data analysis using Power BI and after we designed a binary classification algorithm to predict the OFDA Response.
